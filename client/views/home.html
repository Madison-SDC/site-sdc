		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>As an organization the software development club focuses on fostering practical development skills in students who are interested in computer science. We strive to engage our members in innovative projects, encouraging teamwork and synergy. In doing so we hope to help our members better understand the process of development and concepts taught in class as well as exposing them to topics not covered by the curriculum.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Member Expectations</h2>
		<p>All active members must fulfill club dues. Members engaged in projects should expect to devote 2-3 hours a week to the project. Project groups will give updates on their projects each week at club meetings.
		The weekly club meetings will be 1-2 hours long, including a weekly workshop or presentation focusing on different technologies and other aspects of development. Remaining time is used by groups to work on their projects.</p>
